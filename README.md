# Music_recomendation_web-app
Music recomendation with the same genre of input music by user based on web application


my project group in AI class (This project is for educational purposes only. Thanks for the resources or projects that i used in the study to find guidelines for every project.)

In this project, you can put music files(such as .mp3) that you want to get recomendations. And the back-end will extract the feature of this input to find out what Genre of song is the song that is inserted. in order to recommend songs in the same genre for you
